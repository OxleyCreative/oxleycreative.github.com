					<h3>Introductions</h3>
					<p>Since I'm starting a new blog here, I supposed it would make sense to first introduce myself. My name is Robert Oxley and I am a graphic designer. The way I got into graphic design was a bit convoluted. When I first started at university I was a computer science major. I chose this for a number of reasons some of which included that I love computers, and I wanted to create things. Well after two years in the computer science program at my university, I realized that it was not exactly the career path I wanted to pursue the rest of my life. Unfortunately, I didn't know what I wanted to do instead. It was at this point that I took a year off college to reassess my goals and what I really wanted to do with my life. During this time, I took a volunteer position teaching at a mission school on the border of Mexico is Southern California. While at the school, I taught 1st through 8th grade P.E., 2nd through 6th grade art, and 7th grade ESL math. I had always had a passion for art, and while working at the school I began to consider it as a possibility for a career. After my year was complete and I was headed back to university, I thought about how I could combine my passions. Since I already had a strong computer background, I enjoyed creating, and I loved art Graphic Design just seemed like a natural fit. While I love all of Graphic Design, I would have to say that what I am most passionate about is probably web design. I love print design as well, but it's hard to deny the power and scope of distribution that web design affords. So that's a little bit of the history of how I came to pursue Graphic Design as my field of expertise. Hopefully my blog posts can share a little insight and help others in their creative journeys. Everyone's journey is a bit different but it's nice to share together.
