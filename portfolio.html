					<h3>Battle Creek Academy</h3>
					<p>This represents the web portion of an entire rebranding campaign the school underwent. The color scheme employs a rich blue and dark grey to create a very classy feel. The homepage is designed to present viewers with pertinent information for future events as well as inform them of recent school news. It also works to easily direct visitors to whatever section of the site they are seeking. The interior page maintains a very clean look, while utilizing a side navigation to facilitate quick travel between sub-pages within a section.</p>

					<h3>CSS Zen Garden</h3>
					<p>The idea behind the CSS Zen Garden project was to challenge designers to take their web designs to the next level with skillfully used HTML and CSS techniques. My design was based around a retro gym theme. It used hand-made grunge visuals to create a warm aged aesthetic. It also boasts mustachioed-muscle men to the strength of its CSS.</p>

					<h3>RTO Electronics</h3>
					<p>RTO Electronics was looking for an entire site redesign as well as a new logo. Their business was amatuer radio repair and sales. In demographic research, it became apparent that their site was mainly visited by clientele that were middle-aged or older and in many cases not well versed in newer technologies. To accomodate this we created a very simple three page navigation. We also used large, easily-readable fonts. The color scheme reflects that of the Heathkit company-the primary brand of radio that RTO Electronics repairs. We also created a custom back-end for them using Django.</p>

					<h3>Mount of Olives SDA Church</h3>
					<p>The concept behind this site redesign was built around a combination of grunge elements the client liked with clean typography. The slideshow was designed to draw viewers in as well as exemplify some of the key words that the church's mission statement was based around. The color scheme is based around an olive concept and has a warm friendly appeal.</p>

					<h3>Planet Typography</h3>
					<p>This site redesign was proposed to give a new fresh look to the Planet Typography website. The site's purpose is to inform viewers of the history of different typefaces as well as direct them to where they can acquire the fonts. The redesign employs a very clean, regal aesthetic based around a maroon and black color scheme. The idea is to compliment the information without distracting from the fonts.</p>

					<h3>Official US Time</h3>
					<p>In order to give the official US time website a new more modern look, this redesign sought to interest viewers with some grunge type visuals. At the same time it presented visitors with and easy to use interface and quick navigation to places of interest.</p>

					<h3>The Divine Comedy</h3>
					<p>This site was designed as promotional material for the book The Divine Comedy. It used a combination of vector style graphics with classical illustration to present the content of the book. It also contained interactive elements that would present scenes from the book larger to the viewer.</p>

					<h3>Double Dusk</h3>
					<p>Double Dusk is a website that streams video game content to viewers, while also providing them with a way to chat with each other. The purpose of this site redesign was to give it a clean modern look that would simplify the design and keep it from detracting from the stream. They also requested a logo that I designed along with the site.</p>

					<h3>Costume Party</h3>
					<p>This was a poster I designed for a costume party held at my university that was hosted by the Art&amp;Design Department. It used clean, simple typography along with a strong heirarchy of information to quickly deliver the message to the viewer.</p>

					<h3>Pet Bomb: Anti-War</h3>
					<p>The concept behind this poster was to present a tongue-in-cheek view of the nuclear arms race. It uses humor and retro vector visuals to satire some of the viewpoints that have driven nations to create and stockpile nuclear weapons.</p>

					<h3>ART245: History of Graphic Design</h3>
					<p>This poster was designed to promote the History of Graphic Design class at my university. It employed the visual style Jamie Reid from his work with the Sex Pistols to create a retro design that really illustrated what the class was about.</p>

					<h3>Warhol and Fairey</h3>
					<p>I created this poster as a tribute to Andy Warhol as well as refrencing the appropriation designs of Shepard Fairey. It is meant to invoke a somewhat dark humor by referencing one of Warhol's pieces while being accompanied Fairey's slogan, "Obey."</p>

					<h3>Battle Creek Academy</h3>
					<p>This was an entire rebranding project for the Academy. I started off by developing a typographic logo, which had a very clean sophisticated aesthic. It was meant to invoke feelings of simplicity and order. As a college preparatory school, it was important that they appear professional and organized. This aesthetic along with the rich blue color were then used all their stationary as well as a sixteen page brochure I designed for them. The logo was complimented with clean, simple design to create an elegant look for their brand.</p>

					<h3>Gem Resources International</h3>
					<p>This logo design was for a international aid fund management company. The company provided support for other international charities worldwide. The core concept behind this logo redesign was the expanding influence over the world. The main circular shape represents the globe which is covered with expanding cocentric circles which show how one small event can influence another causing a chain reaction. This illustrates how each good deed encourages another.</p>

					<h3>Kindle: Band</h3>
					<p>This was a logo I created for a local band. I also designed a business card, sticker, button, and some t-shirts for them.There are a number of meanings in this logo. The first lies in the colors
					themselves. The warm orange and rich brown invoke feelings of comfort,
					acceptance, inclusion, hope, and love. Combined with the imagery of a sun
					rising above the kindle word mark, this feeling of hope and joy is made even
					stronger. Also inside the sun imagery, the negative space is employed to
					create an abstracted spark image. This combines nicely with the name itself to
					emphasize the idea of kindle. Throughout the logos simplicity, warmth, and
					clean imagery the ideas of the bands ministry and mission are communicated.</p>

					<h3>Eau Claire SDA Church</h3>
					<p>The concept behind this logo played off the fact that Eau Claire means "Clear Water." The logo uses a drop over the "i" to illustrate a person. This person, or drop, then creates waves throughout their community influencing those around them. This is the core concept behind the mission statement of the church which is to reach out to the community around it. From this logo I then designed business cards, letterhead, and envelopes, as well as a standards manual to inform the church on how to apply the logo.</p>

					<h3>Apple: Parody</h3>
					<p>Apple is extremely popular in the design world, and some people treat them as if they can do no wrong. I think it's only fair that we poke some fun at them from time to time as they have their flaws just like everyone else.</p>

					<h3>Die Jager</h3>
					<p>This was a magazine project I art directed. The concept behind this project was a dark, angsty muscle magazine. With this in mind, I employed the help of a photographer to capture the imagery I wanted. I then designed a layout that the viewer would be drawn through by circles with connecting lines. The idea was to give it a feeling of motion. This was complimented with a dark gray texture and some highlight colors.</p>

					<h3>Merrell: Kick the Elements</h3>
					<p>This was an ad campaign I art directed to sell Merrell shoes. The slogan I concepted for the campaign, "Kick the Elements," was shown by the shoes kicking through water, air, and earth. To complete this goal, I worked with a photographer to capture the various elements in motion as well as stills of the shoe. I then composited the images together and added in text to create the final product.</p>

					<h3>Freshmint</h3>
					<p>My idea for this ad was to take the slogan of the mint, "Calibrated Coolness," and use hyperbole to sell it. So I decided to depict someone trying to cool their mouth off with a fire extinguisher, but then state there's a better way. The concept uses humor to draw the viewer in, and then push the concept that these mints are really cool and refreshing.</p>

					<h3>New York Times: The Shock of the Familiar</h3>
					<p>A while back the New York Times held a design competition for their cover based around the story "The Shock of the Familiar." This concept used a familiar - but shocking - face combined with a toothbrush which tied into their closing line, "From toothbrushes to web pages, a guided tour." The idea was to draw the viewers attention through imagery and a language that they would not be expecting on their news stand.</p>

					<h3>LUCIS Software: Accounting Icons</h3>
					<p>This was part of an icon set I created for a software development company name LUCIS Software.

This was shown in the imagery of the red of the call centers logo covering the globe.</p>

					<h3>Mom: A Picture Accompaniment</h3>
					<p>For this project I was asked to create a card to fill the middle of a tryptych frame for a mother's day gift. The concept was to create a simple elegant design that would not distract from the photos. To accomplish this I simply used the word "mom" accompanied by a poem I wrote for the project. I put these on a gray slightly textured background and gave them an engraved look.</p>
